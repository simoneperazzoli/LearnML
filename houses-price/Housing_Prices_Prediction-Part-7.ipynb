    "## Gradient Boosting Method \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.\n",
    "**Ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests)\n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be like naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start the cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\n",
    "- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (e.g. mean squared error).\n",
    "- Then, the loss function is aplied to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)\n",
    "- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n",
    "- ... repeat!\n"

    "#### Parameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost library has a few parameters that can dramatically affect accuracy and training speed, such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "`n_estimators`: specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above. It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.\n",
    "- Too low a value causes underfitting, which leads to inaccurate predictions on both training data and test data.\n",
    "- Too high a value causes overfitting, which causes accurate predictions on training data, but inaccurate predictions on test data (which is what we care about). Typical values range from 100-1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "` learning_rate`: Instead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.\n",
    "- This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for `n_estimators` without overfitting. If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.\n",
    "- In general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle. As default, XGBoost sets learning_rate=0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "`early_stopping_rounds`: offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tip**: set a high value for n_estimators and then use early_stopping_rounds to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n",
    "- Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores. When using `early_stopping_rounds`, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "`n_jobs`: on larger datasets where runtime is a consideration, you can use parallelism to build your models faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It's common to set the parameter `n_jobs` equal to the number of cores on your machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.\n",
    "- The resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is typically nothing but a distraction. But, it's useful in large datasets where you would otherwise spend a long time waiting during the fit command."
